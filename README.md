This is the code for creation of my Fantasy sports models and prediction algorithms.

I also use this platform for week to week analysis and drafting.

It is a lot of stuff but it is worth it to have everything in one spot.


### Installation

'''bash
./start.sh

'''
The start.sh file contains the commands to start start teh database services, and start the api endpoint instances.


### Components

There are a number of small databases that need to be seeded with data.

The main apis, models, and prediction algorithms are written in python.

The main front end websites for interacting with things is written in react.

### Models

There are a few models that I utilize, I will document them here.



### Running Tests
'''bash 
python -m pytest
'''

### TODO
At somepoint when the apis are big enough and the data insfrastructure is significantly large we should convert the data infrastructure to docker.
